  <title>An XML parser library</title>
  <description>This is expat, the C library for parsing XML, written by James Clark. Expat
is a stream oriented XML parser. This means that you register handlers with
the parser prior to starting the parse. These handlers are called when the
parser discovers the associated structures in the document being parsed. A
start tag is an example of the kind of structures for which you may
register handlers.
