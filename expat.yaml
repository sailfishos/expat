Description: |
    This is expat, the C library for parsing XML, written by James Clark. Expat
    is a stream oriented XML parser. This means that you register handlers with
    the parser prior to starting the parse. These handlers are called when the
    parser discovers the associated structures in the document being parsed. A
    start tag is an example of the kind of structures for which you may
    register handlers.
